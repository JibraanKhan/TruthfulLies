    <h1>Chapter 3 and Truthful Lies</h1>
    <div class="d1">
      <h2>Chapter 3 Summary</h2>
      <p>Sometimes, we need to tell lies in order to show people the entire truth. Our brains are not capable of grasping all the
        information at once, which is why a visualization needs to have a specific focus. This specific focus is determined through what
        the purpose of the visualization is. If a visualization’s purpose to show directions, then a road map would be optimum.
        The representation of the data needs to be universally understood and presented without necessary interaction from the viewer.
        The visualizations need to maximize the amount of information represented, and this information needs to be clarified by the
        visualization, not simplified. We need to reduce the chances of misinterpretations as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>There are many mind bugs, such as Patternicity, Storytelling, and Confirmation. Patternicity is our brain’s tendency to detect
        false patterns, meaning that we look into a pattern in the data and perhaps focus on it even though it does not serve as an aid to
        extend the purpose of the visualization. Storytelling means that assuming causal relationships between two events or patterns we
        see displayed in a visualization, we come up with our own conclusions which lead to misinterpretations and wrong conclusions.
        Confirmation is us sticking to our ideas, whether they be false or not, and being very close minded despite the fact that we may
        be presented with information that is clearly accurate and disproves our own ideas. Instead, we twist that information to confirm
        our own thoughts and ideas
      </p>
      <p>When making visualizations, if you want the visualization to be as truthful as possible you should ask yourself questions in
        order to explore the data set.  It is impossible to create a perfect model but, a model can good enough for the purpose it needs to
        fulfill. We need to include things in our model that will help make it truer, and remove the irrelevant obvious things from the
        model because that will make it simpler and more useful to use.

      <h2>Personal Experience</h2>
      <p>I used to teach students how to code in Lua over discord when I was in high school. Whenever I would teach someone that does not
        have much experience with coding, I would start by saying that these items in studio, the platform used for the language, are just
        items that have certain properties such as color. I would further explain that they are very similar to how things are in today’s
        world, where there are properties, such as material, transparency, and size.
      </p>
      <p>I would not tell them that these are actually objects that you can control using a method of programming called
        object-oriented-programming. Also that they all have their own list of functions and methods defined within the program’s API
        database, and we just use these APIs to enhance the game environment and make use of the objects to create a game’s hierarchy.
        These terms over-complicate the purpose of what I am trying to convey to the student and what the student needs to get off to a
        good start. They do not need to know all of the background right away, they just need to know the surface-level things at first,
        and later into their programming career they can explore these more advanced topics and learn the proper technology. If I was to
        push all of this information onto a student, it would just confuse them and leave them demotivated to begin with, which is not a
        good sign of being a teacher that inspires and starts careers rather than ending them.
